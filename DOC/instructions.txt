## IMPORTANT ##
Keep the directory structure exactly as it is. The scripts rely on this.
They will create a 'build' directory and an 'export' directory as needed.

## Compiling
Download an existing Porteus XFCE desktop and boot into copy2ram with 05-devel.xzm activated.
Follow the build order in DOCS/build-order.txt
The SRC folder contains all the source files required (there are some extra unrequired sources)
The PKG folder contains the slackware packages. After compiling in SRC the final package goes in PKG.
I have kept the PKG folder ordered so you can see what packages are dependencies of an application.

All slackbuilds have the appropriate configure arguments to build.
Build time dependencies can be found in DOCS/buildtime-dependencies.txt
Only install build dependencies as they become required. Remove after compiling.
Sometimes gtk+3 or gobject-introspection needs to be installed just to build the package. It should not be included in the final ISO.
Compiled packages land in /tmp or in the same directory where you are compiling. After compiling move the package into the PKG folder.

## Building the desktop
Once your packages are ready in PKG then you can begin building.
Change into the base folder containing the script xfce-build.sh and run it: sh xfce-build.sh.
It will install all packages and modules in the PKG directory into the build directory.
It will then copy all files from the TREE into build. It will then run the cleanup script
and produce a final 003-xfce.xzm module in the base directory.

## Caches
When testing you MUST boot into text mode (append 3 to the boot line) and run /usr/bin/p_cache as root which is a cache script
in order to generate the required caches. If not the desktop won't boot. It generates a module in
/tmp/009-caches.xzm. MAKE SURE you merge this caches module with the final 003-xfce.xzm module before
the final production ISO. The script you need to run is called p_cache and can be found 

## Procedure for testing desktop
1) Boot into text mode
2) Log in as root
3) run p_cache
4) exit to guest
5) startxfce4 --with-ck-launch 2>/tmp/out

This allows all runtime errors to be logged to /tmp/out. You can check it for any serious errors.
There is a useful script in /opt/porteus-scripts/changes-time. Open it and remove $changes/home and $changes/root.
When you add something to the panel (for example) you can then run this script, choose a time frame, and it will copy
all the files modified in this time to /root/changesxxxx. You can then see which files you need to copy into the TREE.
