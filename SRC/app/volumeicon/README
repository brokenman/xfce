Volume Icon is a lightweight volume control that sits in the systray.

Features :
Change volume by scrolling on the systray icon
Ability to choose which channel to control
Configurable stepsize (percentage of volume change per scrollwheel step)
Several icon themes (with gtk theme as default)
Configurable external mixer
Volume Slider (horizontal or vertical)
Hotkey support
Optional notification support

To enable OSS support, you will need to run the script like this:
OSS=yes ./volumeicon.SlackBuild
By default Volume Icon will be built with ALSA as its backend.
Note that it is not possible to build with both ALSA and OSS support 
at the moment, so using this flag will disable ALSA support.

To enable notifications, you will need to run the script like this:
NOTIFY=yes ./volumeicon.SlackBuild
