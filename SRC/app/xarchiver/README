Xarchiver is a lightweight desktop independent archive manager
built with the GTK+2 toolkit. It is a Desktop Environment independent
archiver frontend.

All common archive types are supported, like zip, arj, bzip2, gzip, rar,
lha, lzma, lzop, deb, rpm, tar and zip archives.
To run it you only need GTK+2 libraries and obviously the various
rar, arj and 7z for these archive types.
