# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

gvfs: gvfs (glib virtual filesystems)
gvfs:
gvfs: gvfs is a userspace virtual filesystem designed to work with the I/O
gvfs: abstractions of libgio (a library included in the glib2 package).
gvfs: It installs several modules that are automatically used by applications
gvfs: that use the libgio API.  There is also fuse support that allows
gvfs: applications not using gio to access the gvfs filesystems.
