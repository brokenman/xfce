# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libsig++: libsig++ (libsigc++ (typesafe callback system for standard C++))
libsig++:
libsig++: libsigc++ implements a typesafe callback system for standard
libsig++: C++. It allows you to define signals and to connect those signals
libsig++: to any callback function, either global or a member function,
libsig++: regardless of whether it is static or virtual. It also contains
libsig++: adaptor classes for connection of dissimilar callbacks and has an
libsig++: ease of use unmatched by other C++ callback libraries.
