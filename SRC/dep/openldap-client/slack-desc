# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name,
# and the '|'on the right side marks the last column you can put a
# character in. You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be
# correct. It's also customary to leave one space after the ':'.
